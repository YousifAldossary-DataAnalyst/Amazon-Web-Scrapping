      "DON'T BUY SAMSUNG TV. DON'T USE AMAZON FOR ONLINE SHOPPING!!!!Here is my whole experience or rather the nightmare.I bought the TV, It has brightness issues. The TV screen is dull even at max brightness. I reported the same to AMAZON. They arranged a tech visit for 4th Aug which never happened, wasted whole day for that visit. They rearranged it for 6th, the tech came and saw the issue they agreed, restarted updated the TV, still the issue was there. I enquired do they agree that issue is there they said Yes. Same evening I called customer support and got the Info that in their system the issue has been updated by the tech firm as resolved. I was dejected and felt cheated. After many hours of calls I was able to get my call transferred to the managers but both the times AMAZON disconnected my call. They kept on sending me messages for feedback. In their system the first visit resolved the issue. One of the customer care executives told me I was supposed to get the report in written from the tech which they did not gave me and did not tell me about. Don't buy this product and even if you want to buy from Flipkart. Samsung and Amazon has degraded their quality. Beware of tech company QDIGI they are the ones responsible for tech visits, read their reviews and you will know. And whats funny is Amzon is still letting them work.\n",

      "   This is my initial impressions. Will update with a detailed review after some time with the television. I would suggest that you go with the UA32TE40AAKBXL 2021 model and not the 2020. The 2021 model has Bluetooth and WiFi 5Ghz. The complete feature set including the availability of apps in the app store will be updated with the detailed review.Some initial impressions:1. The picture quality is good but only for movies. Lack of good resolution is visible in the 32-inch screen.2. This is not suitable for a permanent monitor use case. The sharpness levels and text readability are not good which is one of the primary objectives of a monitor.3. Screen mirroring works with Samsung devices, Apple airplay and laptop. Other Android devices not tested.The screen gets fully covered only when mirroring a laptop. After mirroring the sound is from the TV (tested with Youtube though from the laptop). Mirroring from PC has an audio lag sometimes and flickering picture due to lag.4. The booting time is very less. Please see demo video for that.5. The remote is not suitable for old people who are used to many buttons. 6. I could not properly set the TV with Sity cable. The cable TV remote is required. Universal Remote not working with Sity.7. The sound is idle for a living room. Will not replace a good speaker but decent enough.8. The energy rating is 2 stars with a rated power consumption of 67.42 kWh/Year.9. Samsung servicemen were prompt and installed the wall mount(not in box) without any additional charges.10. I bought this for around 16800.11. The TV has 2 HDMI ports and one USB(the version I am not sure about).Television makers should part ways with 720p screens on TV as in slowly becoming the case with mobile phones. It looks bad on a mobile phone let alone a 32 inch TV. Except that I am satisfied with my purchase. So far so good.\n",

      "Oh the choices we have these days. From HD ready to 4k, thanks to surplus cash in hand, zero interest EMI and Chinese manufacturing.And what do we have in hand? A few HD channels and majority of it in SD broadcast (mind it, the 4:3 vintage quality).  So when 576i source is amplified into full HD (not even 4k) in our large screen chinese imports(or Indian assembles), what we get is immersive, yet immensely dull rendering as you watch it from a distance. That's where 32\" tv comes handy. You gotta sit close, like 5-6 feet and that's the best compromise. Those who rely mainly on SD content, get this. The upscaling to HD screen is much better than in the other brands. Choice is between 'dull, large screen' vs 'small(32), crisp images'. I went for the latter.Yes, picture is sharp. Bright. Vivid. By that, i mean nothing life-like. Life is dull and boring, remember? We apply instagram filters to make it rich, it's the same here. You can dull it all down if you want in the settings. But yeah, the tv is a joy to watch.Much have been berated about the sound, I don't find room to complain anymore. The modern human want the most powerful car with the highest fuel efficiency. He seem to believe that he can get everything- use your brain for a while- a compact package would only give little room for the speakers, so how much loud can they really be? It is good for a bedroom or a small living room. There's lack of bass, but audio and music sounds much clear. There is also a clear voice mode.  Think of it as an expanded phone speaker- serves the purpose.There's ample smart apps and there's also a HDR mode even for non-HD content- not sure what it does to the picture, haven't tested enough.  Power consumption is a humble 45W (this at full backlight/contrast, will go down if you reduce it ) so you can run it on your home UPS all day. There's less heat from the back.TV starts within seconds and displays the hdmi input (dth box, in my case) which is so much of a + over the cheap android tvs.Pen drive plays hevc content too! That's a +. Of course, impeccable quality with HD and full HD content.Around 15k INR, what you get is a 50% higher priced LG than the TCL, Vu equivalent, but what you also get is the peace of mind of owning a brand that actually provides a warranty service. It's like buying a toyota. You would only realize the premium paid in the long term ownership. It's small, but it's a joy to watch.\n",

      "Good product. Costed me 13999. Great picture. Very avg sound.Pros:# Big IPS screen and amazing viewing angle.# Smart features are Okay. Webos is actually better architected compared to Android which never made for TVs. You need to understand but there are pros and cons.# 4GB available memory.# Conntivity to wifi is seamless. Dealing with text is very tricky.# LG installation done over a swiveling wall mount bracket so TV can be vertically adjusted.# Android based app on your smart phone can replace the TV remote and a big help navigating.# wifi remain connected when TV is on standby mode. So you can power it on from Android based remote app. So don't regret for bluetooth and magic remote.# there is a LAN ethernet port incase it's a need.# One configured it auto searches for input and displays the content from my AV set top box. No hassle for elderly members as they don't have to learn anything new.# Comes with latest Webos Firmware and will auto upgrade if it's configured accordingly.CONS@ Sound is disappointing. My 10 year old Sony Bravia 22 inch with 5 watt RMS output sounds better.@ YouTube app do not come out of the box. Not a cons but you need to download it.@ The inbuilt browser is very inefficient. I cannot still sign into Google account due to missing plug in support. Still researching.@ One is completely dependent ON LG for firmware and app updates. This is a big disadvantage.@ missing Bluetooth is a big drawback. But I don't complain due to its cost. Better to have less feature than having everything of low quality.@ installation team did a very shoddy job. Wall bracket is fixed with 3 screws instead of 4. Amazon did not help Inspite of notifying. So be present and check all these nitty gritties.Hope this helps.\n",

      "TV is beautiful with minute bezels.I was pleased by the picture quality in firstI expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus.Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.But hold bluetooth was very functional. Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list\n",

      "ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.\n",

Might be as it is bluetooth 5.0, TV was able to connect to 3+ devices at a time. 1 mobile, 1 bluetooth speaker and remote. That's great.Coming to sound, Speaker quality isn't upto mark. You have multiple options to enhance audio (dolby, surround, presets, dialogue enhancer etc) probably that's the reason oneplus skipped 3.5mm output and opted for optical and HDMI ARC ports to provide quality auido output on external speaker. You should go RCA audio adapters if you want 3.5mm input else connect to speakers using bluetooth adapter. That would cost additional if you want to.If you look for picture quality, minimal design and stick to few ott app this TV is for you.For power users and those who use only 3.5 jack to connect speakers look else where.Update :Oneplus released major update and UI and remote control navigation seems improved now.But setup of new Bluetooth connection got buggy. Im not able to connect to new devices. It is looping back to searching devices after clicking on device after search list\n",

      "ere is my experience with the Oneplus LAGGY tv32Y model. Here is a list of issues with your product.1. connected to Samsung mobile through google home as the tv isn't connecting through Samsung smart view. always says unable to connect, try again. And even through the google home, it is struggling too much to even cast the photos and forget about casting the videos.2. Neither windows nor Mac is recognising The tv in wireless mode. Had to use third party app from play store to Airplay my Mac n gues what, windows is not recognising the tv. It is really shocking to see Mac recognised where Windows couldn’t (using third party play store app).3. To my bad, even through third party play store app, it is laggy half of the times.4. And how can I ignore to say about Oneplus connect app, Its a wonders**t app, do the gesture wait for couple of seconds and then it responds and you can’t access files through the connect app on this tv.5. And sound, it has options by the name, dolby Audio and Dolby digital plus, fix this in your mind, these two features are just names and these does change the sound experience by zero percentage.6. On Youtube, video quality is limited to 1080p, best to use HDMi cable to your happy and play 4K, only then it felt better than any other video quality experience of this tv.7. Opening and closing apps, is like suspense thriller movie scene experience, you will be waiting to know when it will respond.sometimes suspense extends to 3-10 seconds.8. Viewing angles? acceptable for this price.9. Colors? Green is worst of all and then red , black is good, blue colors are worst, yellows are good and the rest that you find are acceptable.10. Display quality? If any of you ever used the Chinese phones of the last decade, you will get the exact same feeling. I promise you this.11. Best option to put  good use of display and colors is to use pen drive, hard disk or HDMI and play the 4k or full HD videos. This is the only way that this display can make you happy.12. And the remote, the menu button literally never worked on  any app nor on home page. It just exists with void function assigned to it.13. Almost forgot about voice search that is google assistance, 10 out of 10 times, it took 3-10 seconds to launch it.14. Opening an app, Fix in your mind that it will take at least 3-10.15. Once you connect Bluetooth accessory, you have to remove the device from the list, if you want to connect it to other device. you will not have an option to disconnect.\n",

      "DON'T BUY SAMSUNG TV. DON'T USE AMAZON FOR ONLINE SHOPPING!!!!Here is my whole experience or rather the nightmare.I bought the TV, It has brightness issues. The TV screen is dull even at max brightness. I reported the same to AMAZON. They arranged a tech visit for 4th Aug which never happened, wasted whole day for that visit. They rearranged it for 6th, the tech came and saw the issue they agreed, restarted updated the TV, still the issue was there. I enquired do they agree that issue is there they said Yes. Same evening I called customer support and got the Info that in their system the issue has been updated by the tech firm as resolved. I was dejected and felt cheated. After many hours of calls I was able to get my call transferred to the managers but both the times AMAZON disconnected my call. They kept on sending me messages for feedback. In their system the first visit resolved the issue. One of the customer care executives told me I was supposed to get the report in written from the tech which they did not gave me and did not tell me about. Don't buy this product and even if you want to buy from Flipkart. Samsung and Amazon has degraded their quality. Beware of tech company QDIGI they are the ones responsible for tech visits, read their reviews and you will know. And whats funny is Amzon is still letting them work.\n",

      "   This is my initial impressions. Will update with a detailed review after some time with the television. I would suggest that you go with the UA32TE40AAKBXL 2021 model and not the 2020. The 2021 model has Bluetooth and WiFi 5Ghz. The complete feature set including the availability of apps in the app store will be updated with the detailed review.Some initial impressions:1. The picture quality is good but only for movies. Lack of good resolution is visible in the 32-inch screen.2. This is not suitable for a permanent monitor use case. The sharpness levels and text readability are not good which is one of the primary objectives of a monitor.3. Screen mirroring works with Samsung devices, Apple airplay and laptop. Other Android devices not tested.The screen gets fully covered only when mirroring a laptop. After mirroring the sound is from the TV (tested with Youtube though from the laptop). Mirroring from PC has an audio lag sometimes and flickering picture due to lag.4. The booting time is very less. Please see demo video for that.5. The remote is not suitable for old people who are used to many buttons. 6. I could not properly set the TV with Sity cable. The cable TV remote is required. Universal Remote not working with Sity.7. The sound is idle for a living room. Will not replace a good speaker but decent enough.8. The energy rating is 2 stars with a rated power consumption of 67.42 kWh/Year.9. Samsung servicemen were prompt and installed the wall mount(not in box) without any additional charges.10. I bought this for around 16800.11. The TV has 2 HDMI ports and one USB(the version I am not sure about).Television makers should part ways with 720p screens on TV as in slowly becoming the case with mobile phones. It looks bad on a mobile phone let alone a 32 inch TV. Except that I am satisfied with my purchase. So far so good.\n",
